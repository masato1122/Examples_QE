# Examples_QE
Examples of simulations with QuantumEspresso

Prerequisite
------------

To use python scripts prepared, the following libralies need to be installed in advance.

* python
* pymatgen
* seekpath
* pyyaml

These python libralies can be installed with the following command.
If you have troubles, you can skip this part.

```
pip install pymatgen seekpath seekpath pyyaml
```

> **NOTE:** If you don't have python on your computer, you need to install python. Anaconda is a useful installer of a set of different python libraries: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution.


Installation of these examples
------------------------------

```
git clone https://github.com/masato1122/Examples_QE.git
```

If you don't have ``git`` command, download a zip file and unzip under the directory you like.
